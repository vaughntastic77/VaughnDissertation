\chapter{FUTURE WORK}

Will do pressure test, program controls, final assembly, calibration, and finally experiments. A few objectives will be accomplished during the fabrication, install, and calibration.

Experiments and work in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Characterization of noise and uniformity throughout nozzle with hysteresis
    \item Model BL, shock, and heating hysteresis
    \item Constant/proportional Re/m controls if able
\end{enumerate}
